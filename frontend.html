<!-- This tag is required. It tells the Browser which version of html you are using. For HTML5, use the doctyp declaration below.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- You have to start and end an html file's contents with an opening and closing <html></html> tag (for the Browser to know where it starts and ends).-->
<!-- The "lang=en" placed within the opening <html> tag contains the attribute "lang" which tells the Browser which language your content is in (used for search engine pages).-->
<html lang= "en">
    <!-- Content in the head is information used by Search Engines and Browsers regarding your site.-->
    <head>
        <!-- <meta> tags are void elements/tags, meaning that they don't hold content so there is no need to have a closing </meta> tag.
            Meta tags provide information about your site to the Search Engine (and Browser in some regards).
            It is not required, but since <meta> is self closing, it has the option to include a bashslash "/" if you want to or not.

        <!--The "charset" attribute tells the Browser what character encoding to use for the page. "utf-8" is the Unicode character set (set of characters that cover almost all writing systems in the world.)-->

        <!-- 
            The "name" and "content" attributes often tell the Search Engine what to display on the SERP (Search Engine Result Page). 
            In some cases, it simply provides additional meta data such as keywords, authors, viewpoint settings, etc.
            The "name" attribute contains the name of the meta data (or category of meta data contained within the "content" attribute).

            name="keywords" content="..." ("content" contains keywords for the Search Engine)
            name="description" content="..." ("content" contains a description of the web page)
            name="author" content="..." ("content" contains the author/creator of the page)

            As of HTML5, <link> tag must be a self closing, meaning that it does not need a closer tag much like <meta>.
